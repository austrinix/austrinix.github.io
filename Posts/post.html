  <hr>
  <p>
    The WannaCry ransomware attack's main exploit was an exploit that you didn't even need to do anything to get infected. And to protect against these viruses follow these steps:
    Always have an antivirus: Windows has an built in antivirus but it is not as great so use third party software, some good ones are: Malwarebytes, Avast, McAfee, BitDefender (highly recommended), AVG, ZoneAlarm, Avira, TotalAV etc. For MacOS/OS X you don't need an antivirus it has a strong built in Firewall and Antivirus and Linux needs no antivirus because it is completely risk free! A free antivirus setup could be BitDefender Free and Windows Firewall, ZoneAlarm Firewall or Comodo Firewall!
    
    Backup your files, back up your files with clouds like OneDrive, Dropbox and iCloud. Or use Internet Services to backup files like Mega.NZ, Google Drive and more so the files get uploaded to the company's servers! Or create a recovery drive/USB (has to be an actual drive not a virtual one) after you connected the actual not virtual drive/USB, copy all of your data and add it to the USB/Drive, and then disconnect the device so a virus or ransomware can't encrypt or infect the files!
    
    Don't download suspicious files, files from the internet are useful, but sometimes, they are indeed dangerous, if you installed software which your antivirus says it is safe, go to www.virustotal.com, if only a few antiviruses say that it is dangerous, that means it may be a false positive, if you got many antiviruses saying that it is dangerous, uninstall it now, or delete it! Also keep your account on your computer signed in to your non-admin account, so if you download any file which is infected, it won't have full advantage of your computer because
    if you are signed in with your admin account, then the hacker or virus will have full advantage of your computer and then will exploit it.
    
    Here are all the threats of the virus-list.
    Trojan - a virus that exploits and infects files.
    Ransomware - a virus that encrypts all files on the machine on all drives connected.
    Spyware - infects your computer by violating their privacy or endangering their device's security.
    Exploits - a virus made to hijack a computer and get hold of it.
    Hacking - cyber-criminals that hijack a computer and get hold of it. Not all hackers are bad visit the article at:
    Browser Hijackers - these are exploits to your browser, browser hijackers mostly modify the browsers settings without the users permission.
    PUPs: apps that are infected with viruses that infect your computer. The full form of PUPs is Potentially Unwanted Programs. They usually come bundled with others software.
    Rogues: rogues have the same meaning as PUPs.
    Malware - a threat that mostly tries to get hold of a computer, trying to spoil it.
    
    To get rid of a live virus, you need to install Malwarebytes Free Trial at www.malwarebytes.com or www.malwarebytes.org, then just hit on next on he setup, select "Free Trial" and then hid on continue, then hit on scan, and if it detects threats, hid on "Quarintine" and then it will send all viruses to Quarintine, and then just hit on Quarintine on the app, then delete all files, (Note that it is not needed to delete the files since it is in quarintine.) If you have other antivirus software, uninstall Malwarebytes now!
